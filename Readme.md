While on holiday in Prague, CZ, I found myself scanning a QR code in [Vysehrad](https://www.praha-vysehrad.cz/cs) which led me to an expired domain.

Since I hated that this link was a dead end, I decided to fix it and I registered the domain, linking back to the original project on instagram and other Czech indepentent artists as I stumble across them.

If you want your art project listed please [get in touch](https://github.com/cedmax/vyseart/issues). I'm not guaranteeing I'm adding everything, but I'll sure come back to you.
